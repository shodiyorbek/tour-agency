# Booking System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive booking system has been implemented for the tour agency application, allowing users to book tours with a multi-step process.

## Components Created

### 1. **Booking Hook (`src/hooks/use-booking.ts`)**
- Manages booking state with localStorage persistence
- Handles booking creation, updates, and cancellations
- Provides booking calculations and status management
- Exports TypeScript interfaces for `Booking` and `PassengerDetails`

### 2. **Booking Provider (`src/components/booking-provider.tsx`)**
- Context provider for global booking state access
- Makes booking functionality available throughout the app
- Follows the same pattern as the wishlist provider

### 3. **Booking Modal (`src/components/booking-modal.tsx`)**
A multi-step modal with 4 steps:
- **Step 1: Passengers** - Select number of passengers
- **Step 2: Details** - Enter passenger information and contact details
- **Step 3: Review** - Review all booking details
- **Step 4: Payment** - Choose payment method and complete booking

Features:
- Form validation at each step
- Dynamic passenger forms based on selection
- Multiple payment options (Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer)
- Animated transitions between steps
- Booking confirmation with auto-redirect

### 4. **Booking Confirmation Page (`src/app/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`)**
- Displays detailed booking information
- Shows passenger details, payment summary, and tour information
- Includes print and share functionality
- Provides navigation to view all bookings

### 5. **My Bookings Page (`src/app/my-bookings/page.tsx`)**
- Lists all user bookings
- Provides filtering by status (All, Confirmed, Pending, Cancelled)
- Search functionality by booking reference, destination, or tour name
- Sorting options (Recent, Oldest, Price)
- Booking statistics dashboard
- Cancel booking functionality

### 6. **Navigation Updates (`src/components/sections/Navigation.tsx`)**
- Added "My Bookings" link with booking counter badge
- Integrated booking context for real-time updates
- Mobile responsive navigation

### 7. **Tours Section Updates (`src/components/sections/ToursSection.tsx`)**
- Integrated booking modal with tour cards
- "Book Now" buttons trigger booking flow
- Maintains tour data throughout booking process

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React Context API for global state
- localStorage for data persistence
- TypeScript for type safety

### Dependencies Added
- `date-fns` - For date formatting
- `framer-motion` - For animations (already in use)

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Booking {
  id: string
  tourId: number
  tour: Tour
  passengers: PassengerDetails[]
  numberOfPassengers: number
  totalPrice: number
  specialRequests?: string
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'cancelled'
  bookingDate: string
  paymentMethod?: 'card' | 'paypal' | 'bank-transfer'
  contactDetails: {
    email: string
    phone: string
  }
}

interface PassengerDetails {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
  phone: string
  dateOfBirth: string
  passportNumber?: string
